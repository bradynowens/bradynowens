## Hi, I'm Bradyn👋

### I am currently pursuing my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at Wright State University.

## Projects

### - Hammurabi game with Python Code

* Worked on this when I took Wright State CS-1160 equivalent.
* Basically follows the original game design
* Start with a certain amount of resources and population and the goal is to manage the resources while keep population up and growing for ten years. After ten years the game ends and you win.

### - Catacomb Crawler game with Java Code

* Worked on this when I took CS-1180.
* Start by picking a number between 5 and 10
* Catacomb with 5x5, 10x10 or 6x6 is created, depending on the number you chose
* Your hero spawns in the top right, (0,0), and as you navigate to the bottom right, (4,4), you might encounter monsters to fight.
* The ultimate goal is to make it to the exit of the catacomb.
